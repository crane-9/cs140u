1. There is no extension for the README file in this assignment because a readme's file format doesn't really matter, so long as the readme's contents are text. `.txt` and `.md` are most popular.

2. I've been using Windows all my life so I know it best:
    
    1. Using `WinKey` + `:`, on modern versions I believe, opens a small popup with a catalogue of emojis. Ironically I don't often use emojis, unless programming (ie. Discord bot or website). I like this because it's quick and convenient, I am not going to memorize their unicode values, and I hate googling "alien emoji" to copy and paste the character. This is built into the OS as far as I am aware.
    2. Using `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `S` opens a screenshot snippet tool. Using this is really smooth and streamlined. It immediately copies the screenshot to your clipboard as well. This also ships with the OS as far as I'm aware.
    3. `WinKey` + `V` opens up a clipboard history, if enabled. This is also very convenient, especially when it comes to coding. This is a system feature that ships with the OS, as far as I know.
    4. Windows has had some classic and iconic screensavers and desktop backgrounds.
    5. I love the control panel's layout, I think the clusters of organization make a lot of sense, and exploring this menu was important to me when I was young and getting to know computers.

3. I am tired of Windows, and increasingly frustrated with its limitations, so I'm working on migrating to Linux.

    1. Cortana/Co-Pilot. I'm not a fan of AI/voice assistants, especially when their setup menus cannot be permanently dismissed or disabled.
    2. Windows 8's bizarre [tile screen](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwinaero.com%2Fblog%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F02%2Fdesktop-tile-is-back.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=29cf113bd900566df80c7ea88fe239868864e0fa7efcae3bd70f5b4770209e1d&ipo=images), which is a symbol of something greater for me. This felt like a turning point for Microsoft's design choices with Windows -- though it could be personal opinion/bias -- where minimalist aesthetic began to take priority. 
    3. [Windows 11 sends out marketing data on startup.](https://www.techradar.com/news/is-windows-11-spying-on-you-new-report-details-eye-opening-levels-of-telemetry) Also the increasing use of advertisement in Start menus, lockscreens, and notifications.
    4. Lacking customization/flexibility. Though the deeper issue is...
    5. Increasing push of Microsoft's own products over third-party: Edge, a Microsoft account, OneDrive, etc.

4. Misc sources.
