# Assignment 4

For this assignment, I'm following [the suggested tutorial](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial).


Built scripts:

1. [`scratch.sh`](./scratch.sh)

2. [`input.sh`](./input.sh)

3. [`trap.sh`](./trap.sh)

4. [`arrays.sh`](./arrays.sh)

5. [`arrays_2.sh`](./arrays_2.sh)

    - Creates an array using `declare` and reads from file line by line.

6. [`functions.sh`](./functions.sh)

7. [`new_script.sh`](./new_script.sh)

    - Implemented this script to make the creation of a new script easier. Had this idea way too late into the tutorial.

8. [`redirects.sh`](./redirects.sh)

    - I note this in the comments, but I don't fully understand the redirect syntax, as this tutorial is all the information I've got on it: I have no sense for the standard anatomy of redirection.
